				<p>First and important, <strong>would you like to help Thymeleaf?</strong> then the
				easiest ways to do so is to be vocal about your use of it, and to allow us
				to mention you on this page. Just that! We would only need your logo and a brief
				one/two paragraph text. Please <a href="#users">have a look here</a>.</p>

				<p><em>Exactly how much is Thymeleaf being used?</em>  Well... we don't know for
				sure :-) Thymeleaf is open source, free, and downloadable without
				restrictions, so there is actually no reason why anyone would come and 
				tell us <em>'hey - we're using your software!'</em>... &mdash; We
				actually love it like that because it gives our users total freedom, but
				the downside is we are not able to offer accurate data about the real
				degree of success the project is enjoying.</p>

				<p>Alright so, what can we show you here? Two things: first, some
				<strong>download figures</strong>. And second, some info about those
				<strong>companies or projects using thymeleaf</strong> who have been so
				kind to take part in this section &mdash; thanks to all of them!</p>

				</header>
				<p>These are our figures for <strong>downloads per month</strong> for the last year,
				measured by the <a href="http://search.maven.org/">Maven Central
				repository</a>, and only referred to the thymeleaf <em>core</em> jar, this
				is, not including Spring integration, extras, etc. Also, these figures
				do not include distribution (<em>.zip</em> file) downloads from
				the <a href="https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-dist/releases/">binary releases distribution at GitHub</a>.</p>

				<p><em>Cool people use cool technologies!</em> Below you will be able to
				see some really interesting names, and learn in their own words what
				brought them to Thymeleaf and how they are currently using it.</p>

				<p>If your <strong>company</strong>, <strong>commercial product</strong>,
				<strong>open source project</strong> or popular <strong>public website</strong> is
				using Thymeleaf in production and you would like it to be listed here, we would just need
				a logo, a brief paragraph or two describing how Thymeleaf is being used, and of course
				your permission to show both things here :)</p>

				<p>It's very easy, just <a href="team.html">contact us</a>. Or
				<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6NM3bppNhkOBtlDMUgR9zzzGE1kBvnsmyBA75nhFQQABOFA/viewform">fill

							<p><strong>Across</strong> is an open source Java framework for the

							both a way to define application modules, as well as the infrastructure
							to run the application.</p>

							<p>We needed a straightforward, powerful and extensible templating
							framework that enabled us to embed the templates in our modules. Thymeleaf
							is just that. It allows for natural templating, can do complex processing
							and lets us easily define custom dialects. On top of that, Thymeleaf
							facilitates the collaboration of both front end and back end developers
							on the same template file, greatly increasing productivity.</p>

							<p>Auchan Retail France is using Thymeleaf for French ecommerce platform Server Side

							<p>After an overwhelmingly positive building experience, picking a

								was obvious. We currently leverage Thymeleaf for both our 3.0 demo
								site and internal admin tool.</p>

							<p>Starting with version 5, CAS has entirely embraced Thymeleaf as its main UI
							templating/rendering engine. We wanted to find a platform that was open source,
							license-friendly to CAS, lightweight and modern. As changing the CAS look and feel
							is one of the most common deployment considerations, we also wanted the UI engine
							to not require a ton of programming expertise for beginners, and unlike the old JSP
							model, be flexible to run in any browser without any upfront hassle. Thymeleaf fit
							the criteria perfectly, and of course built-in support via Spring Boot was certainly
							very good encouragement and reassurance.</p>

							<p>Thymeleaf is used to render the frontend, e-mail templates and also Handlebars

							<p>While searching for a better way to produce HTML - we discovered Thymeleaf. The
