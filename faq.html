						<h3>
							<a id="where-come-from" href="#where-come-from" class="anchor"></a>
							Where does Thymeleaf come from? Is it made or backed by any software company?
						</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Thymeleaf is Open Source Software originally created by a Spanish Software Engineer 
						called Daniel Fern√°ndez and now developed and maintained
						by a great <a href="team.html">team of awesome people</a>.</p>

					<p>It is neither made nor backed by any software (or any other type of)
						company, and it is offered to the public totally free of charge, both in
						binary and in source code forms, under the <b>Apache License 2.0</b>.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="subsection">
					<header>
						<h3>
							<a id="is-it-stable" href="#is-it-stable" class="anchor"></a>
							Is it stable? Can it be considered production-ready?
						</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Yes, all stable (non-beta) releases can be considered
					production-ready.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="subsection">
					<header>
						<h3>
							<a id="does-offer-support" href="#does-offer-support" class="anchor"></a>
							Does Thymeleaf offer any type of commercial support?
						</h3>
					</header>
					<p>No, it does not. Official commercial support is not offered at the
					moment.</p>
				</section>

						<h3>
							<a id="who-is-using-thymeleaf" href="#who-is-using-thymeleaf" class="anchor"></a>
							Who is using Thymeleaf?
						</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Our '<a href="whoisusingthymeleaf.html">Who is using Thymeleaf?</a>'
					page contains a list of companies using Thymeleaf in their products,
					projects, websites, or even offering it as a part of their
					Professional Services portfolio. You will find some download figures
					there, too.</p>

						<h3>
							<a id="versioning-policy" href="#versioning-policy" class="anchor"></a>
							What is the project's versioning policy?
						</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Thymeleaf version numbers have three components: <code>x.y.z</code>
					(like: <code>2.0.1</code>).</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<code>x</code> is the <b>major version number</b>. A change in
							this number means a rewrite of the core or architecture, or an
							important amount of changes in the library's APIs which might
							break backwards compatibility and/or legacy support.
						</li>
						<li>
							<code>y</code> is the <b>minor version number</b>. A change in
							this number means a moderate set of changes has been applied,
							offering new features and improvements without changing APIs
							significantly and providing <i>deprecation</i> periods for all
							changed features in order to allow for a period of adaptation to
							the new interfaces.
						</li>
						<li>
							<code>z</code> is the <b>build/bugfix version number</b>. A change
							in this number means the fix of some bugs or the addition of a
							series of performance or documentation improvements. <i>Bugfix
							versions</i> should modify no APIs and be therefore <i>drop-in</i>
							replacements for any previous version within the same major+minor
							version.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section class="subsection">
					<header>
						<h3>
							<a id="how-can-i-contribute" href="#how-can-i-contribute" class="anchor"></a>
							How can I contribute to Thymeleaf?
						</h3>
					</header>
					<p>The first and most useful way to contribute to the project is by
					helping other users at popular places like
					<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/thymeleaf">StackOverflow</a>.
					Building a better community is always priority number
					one.</p>

					<p>You can also help Thymeleaf by promoting it: write on your blog,
					tweet, talk about it at your local JUG, or even simply discuss its
					advantages at your company/work and among your colleague developers.
					Help spread the word. Do you think your grandma might be interested?
					Tell her! :-)</p>

					<p>If you are already doing your best at helping users and promoting,
					and still you feel that you could do more, there are a couple of
					things that are always useful:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Help testing. No amount of testing is enough testing, and your
							experience as a user is extremely valuable for building useful
							tests that Thymeleaf's developers might never think of.  Thymeleaf
							has its own <a href="http://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-testing">testing
							library</a> and its own <a href="http://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-tests">repository
							for tests</a>, and there's always room for contributions there. If
							you want suggestions about what to test, we can guide you towards
							the areas that might better benefit from your help.
						</li>
						<li>
							Help documenting. There's an "Articles" section at the <a href="documentation.html">documentation
							page</a> that always welcomes new articles, especially if they
							include a nice example application. Your name will be displayed as
							author at the article, so that you can add it to your resume ;),
							but of course we will ask you for a high level of quality and a
							good knowledge of the English language. We keep a list of topic
							suggestions <a href="http://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf.github.com/issues">here</a>,
							but you can always propose your own to the Team.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>What else? Well, of course you can bring your own ideas! You can
					create a <a href="http://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf.github.com/issues">GitHub
					issue</a> or just send an email directly to the <a href="team.html">Team</a>.
					We will be happy to review and discuss your ideas with you.  Please
					don't just upload a Pull Request with your favourite feature without
					previous discussion with the team &mdash; Thymeleaf is a complex
					project and requires a certain level of organization, and we might not
					be able to accept your code even if you put a lot of effort on it (or
					even if your idea is good!).</p>

					<p>Finally, please note that <b>all artifact contributions to
					Thymeleaf (code, documentation...) are regulated by certain
					<a href="https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-dist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.markdown">Terms
					and Conditions</a></b>. Before accepting any patches, articles, etc.
					from you we will require you to explicitly agree on this terms (an
					email or a github comment will do).</p>

							<a id="pronunciation" href="#pronunciation" class="anchor"></a>
							How do you pronounce 'thymeleaf'?

					</header>
					<p>In case you are unsure, 'Thymeleaf' is pronounced like this:

				<section class="subsection">
					<header>
						<h3>
							<a id="is-web-framework" href="#is-web-framework" class="anchor"></a>
							Is Thymeleaf a web framework?
						</h3>
					</header>
					<p>No, it isn't. It is a template engine.</p>

					<p>Template engines play a key role in web frameworks, though, and are
					one of its most important components as they are in charge of
					producing the user interface or <i>view layer</i> (usually in XHTML or
					HTML form).</p>

					<p><i>Spring MVC</i>, <i>Struts</i> or <i>Apache Wicket</i> are
					examples of web frameworks, whereas <i>JSP</i>, <i>Velocity</i> or
					<i>FreeMarker</i> are examples of template engines.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="subsection">
					<header>
						<h3>
							<a id="what-types-of-templates" href="#what-types-of-templates" class="anchor"></a>
							What types of templates can Thymeleaf process?
						</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Thymeleaf templates can be:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>HTML (HTML5, XHTML 1.0/1.1, HTML 4)</li>
						<li>XML</li>
						<li>TEXT (plain text)</li>
						<li>JAVASCRIPT (.js files)</li>
						<li>CSS (.css files)</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section class="subsection">
					<header>
						<h3>
							<a id="substitute-jsp" href="#substitute-jsp" class="anchor"></a>
							Can Thymeleaf be used as a complete substitute for JSP and JSTL?
						</h3>
					</header>
					<p><b>Absolutely</b>. Not only it can, but we strongly encourage you
					to do so. Have a look at our <a href="/doc/articles/thvsjsp.html">Thymeleaf vs.
					JSP</a> article if you want to learn how these two technologies
					compare.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="subsection">
					<header>
						<h3>
							<a id="compare-other-engines" href="#compare-other-engines" class="anchor"></a>
							How does Thymeleaf compare with other template engines like
							Velocity or FreeMarker?
						</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Both <i>Velocity</i> and <i>FreeMarker</i> are terrific pieces of
					software, but they approach the templating problem with a philosophy
					quite different to that of Thymeleaf.</p>

					<p>Thymeleaf makes a strong stress on <i>natural templating</i>
					&mdash;allowing templates to be working prototypes, which the other
					two do not allow&mdash;, and its syntax tries to be (arguably) cleaner
					and more in tune with the current trends in web development. Also,
					from an architectural standpoint, both <i>Velocity</i> and <i>FreeMarker</i>
					work as sequential text processors whereas Thymeleaf is based on markup parsing
					techniques. This allows Thymeleaf to take advantage of interesting features
					specific to markup-based environments, especially the web.</p>

					<p>Anyway, the best way to compare these technologies is to use them
					yourself and feel which one suits you best.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="subsection">
					<header>
						<h3>
							<a id="can-it-non-web" href="#can-it-non-web" class="anchor"></a>
							Can it be used outside web applications in non-web environments?
						</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Yes it can. Although Thymeleaf (especially its <i>Standard</i>
					dialects) offers many features that are especially useful in web
					environments, it can be used for processing non-web HTML or XML documents
					(data XML, for example) or other types of templates that are not meant
					for being sent via HTTP (for example, text/HTML email content).</p>
				</section>

				<section class="subsection">
					<header>
						<h3>
							<a id="no-spring-can-I-use" href="#no-spring-can-I-use" class="anchor"></a>
							I don't use Spring at all. Can I still use Thymeleaf?
						</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Absolutely. Thymeleaf offers nice integration with Spring MVC
					through its <i>SpringStandard</i> dialect (included in the
					<code>thymeleaf-spring3</code>, <code>thymeleaf-spring4</code> and <code>thymeleaf-spring5</code>
					packages), but Spring integration is completely optional and the
					<i>Standard</i> dialect is in fact meant to be used without Spring.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="subsection">
					<header>
						<h3>
							<a id="use-snapshot" href="#use-snapshot" class="anchor"></a>
							How can I use a SNAPSHOT release of Thymeleaf?
						</h3>
					</header>
					<p>From time to time, Thymeleaf will produce a <i>snapshot</i> release
					that will allow you to test new or being-developed features. These are
					<b>non production ready</b> releases, but will be stable enough for
					most testing purposes, and will enable you to try new features before
					they are generally available.</p>

					<p>In order to use snapshot releases, you need to add the Sonatype OSS
					Snapshots repository in your Maven <code>pom.xml</code> file, like
					this:</p>

					<pre><code class="language-xml"><!--
						<repositories>
							<repository>
								<id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>
								<name>Sonatype Nexus Snapshots</name>
								<url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
								<snapshots>
									<enabled>true</enabled>
								</snapshots>
							</repository>
						</repositories>
					--></code></pre>

					<p>Also, you will have to modify your Thymeleaf dependency/ies to use
					a <i>snapshot version</i>, which usually consists of the version
					number of the <b>next</b> release (not the current one), followed by
					<code>-SNAPSHOT</code>. For example, if <code>3.1.3.RELEASE</code> is the
					latest published stable release, snapshots will probably appear under
					the <code>3.1.4-SNAPSHOT</code> or even
					<code>3.2.0-SNAPSHOT</code> version numbers:</p>

					<pre><code class="language-xml"><!--
						<dependency>
							<groupId>org.thymeleaf</groupId>
							<artifactId>thymeleaf</artifactId>
							<version>3.1.4-SNAPSHOT</version>
							<scope>compile</scope>
						</dependency>
					--></code></pre>
				</section>

				<section class="subsection">
					<header>
						<h3>
							<a id="testing" href="#testing" class="anchor"></a>
							How is thymeleaf tested?
						</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Thymeleaf has its own testing framework, called <code>thymeleaf-testing</code>.
					This testing framework not only allows the Thymeleaf Team to easily
					test the library, but also allows users to test the view layer of
					their applications. You can explore it at
					<a href="http://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-testing">GitHub</a>.</p>

					<p>Making use of this testing framework, Thymeleaf maintains another
					GitHub repository completely devoted to tests. Tests, tests, and more
					tests. It's the <code>thymeleaf-tests</code> repository that you can
					find <a href="http://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-tests">here</a>.
					Want some figures? As of June 2014 the <code>thymeleaf-tests</code>
					repository contained more than 1,300 test files, adding up to more
					than 37,000 lines of testing code.</p>

					<p>Besides, we use <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> for
					continuous integration, thanks to what every release is published
					after being tested in no-Spring, Spring 3.0, Spring 3.1, Spring 3.2
					and Spring 4.0 environments, with Java 6, 7 and 8 (unfortunately
					Travis does not support Java 5, so we test that manually).</p>
