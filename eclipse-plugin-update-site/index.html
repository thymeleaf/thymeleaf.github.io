	<p>This is the Thymeleaf Eclipse Plugin Update Site... but if you're reading
	this, then you're visiting with a browser.  Instead, open up Eclipse and
	point it to this update site.</p>

	<p>In Eclipse, go to Help >> Install New Software... then enter this update
	site URL (should be <a href="http://www.thymeleaf.org/eclipse-plugin-update-site/">http://www.thymeleaf.org/eclipse-plugin-update-site/</a>).
	Eclipse should then pick up the plugin to install.</p>

	<p>If you encounter any issues, visit the plugin site's GitHub issues section
	(<a href="https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-extras-eclipse-plugin/issues">https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-extras-eclipse-plugin/issues</a>)
	and raise a new issue or check through the existing closed ones to see if what
	you're encountering has already been resolved.</p>
